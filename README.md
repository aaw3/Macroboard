# MacroBoard

## [Archived Code] Keyboard manager that can discriminate between keyboards, combine inputs from multiple keyboards in a macro, as well as supporting drop in mods as DLLs.

## Depends on [KeyboardHookDLL](https://git.aaw3.dev/allen/KeyboardHookDLL)

## This code is archived, however I might release updates to it in the future

- I have provided a bin release as well as the source code
- I have not worked on this project in over 2 years, the csproj should be updated when recompiling
- This project depends on Linearstar.Windows.RawInput
- I did not know how to use git at the time, so unfortunately there is no history for the project.

## Features
- Distingushing between multiple keyboards
- Combining input across multiple keyboards
- Working with multiple keyboards, or overriding specific keys on one primary keyboard
- Supports drop in mod replacement (Restart will be required, however).
